# hs-competitive-programming
A catch-all repo where you can laugh at all my terrible solutions that actually work.

### Computer Science UIL
A java-based competition for high school students. Problems have a paragraph description with a contrived backstory, but then no one actually reads because it is excess information.

### Lockheed Martin's Codequest
Basically CS UIL, but with whatever programming language you would like.
