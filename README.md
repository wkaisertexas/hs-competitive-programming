# hs-competitive-programming
A catch-all repo where you can laugh at all my terrible solutions that actually work.

### Computer Science UIL
A java-based competition for high school students. Problems have a paragraph description with a contrived backstory, but then no one actually reads because it is excess information.

### Lockheed Martin's Codequest
Basically CS UIL, but with whatever programming language you would like.

### HPE Code Wars
- 2022: the event was just terrible. The submissions were all messup up, and I had to spend the first several minutes trying to figures out how they wanted my answer. Super annoying. Also, problem 12 is the most misogynistic thing I have seen in some time.
