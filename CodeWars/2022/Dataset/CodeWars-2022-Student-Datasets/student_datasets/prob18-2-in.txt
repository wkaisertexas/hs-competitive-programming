A Bay Area city banned new billboards for 36 years. Now, 2 new proposed signs are facing backlash.

The San Jose City Council is set to vote on a controversial proposal next month which would reverse
a 36-year ban on billboards in the city, a plan that has garnered sweeping opposition among
residents.
Two 1,000-square-foot electronic billboards could be constructed along Highway 101 at Mineta San
Jose International Airport if a request from the airport's director of aviation, John Aitken, is
approved, the Mercury News reported Saturday. The implementation of the double-sided LED signs in
partnership with Clear Channel would also result in the removal of eight existing billboards
throughout the city, in addition to bolstering the airport with $600,000 in annual funding as it
struggles to recover from COVID-related losses.
But the San Jose Airport Commission isn't so keen on the idea, rejecting the proposal in a 5-1 vote
last week over concerns related to community pushback and light pollution, per San Jose Spotlight.
"Allowing these in San Jose would be outrageous and wrong," Laurence Kuhn, a founding member of the
Silicon Valley Branch of the U.S. Green Building Council, said at the Jan. 26 meeting. "[I] will
seriously consider moving out of San Jose if these go up. We owe it to the voters and inhabitants
By allowing these first digital billboards at the airport, the city will be opening the floodgates
for dozens of additional billboards and ongoing litigation. Let's not turn our town into another
Los Angeles or Las Vegas."
Staff at the University of California's Lick Observatory, located about 28 miles east of the
airport on the summit of Mount Hamilton, have also voiced their fervent opposition, arguing the
billboards would brighten skies across the region and hinder astronomers, in addition to
distracting drivers and negatively impacting nocturnal wildlife.
"We're detecting new worlds from right here in Santa Clara County," Paul Lynam, a staff astronomer
at the Lick Observatory, told the Mercury News. "Access to these facilities is very important to
people and astronomers across the world. To lose those capabilities would be a travesty."
San Jose adopted a city-wide ban on new billboards in 1985 in response to public backlash over
"visual clutter, blight and message content," according to the city's website. The city council
voted to allow the construction of 22 signs at 17 city-owned sites in 2018; however, none of the
billboard installations have yet been approved or completed. By February 2021, the city halted the
plan entirely due to lack of support â€” a 2021 survey by the San Jose Planning Commission found
that, in a pool of 2,000 residents, 91% of respondents opposed the billboards.
The Federal Aviation Administration has reportedly cleared the project, and airport spokesperson
Keonnis Taylor told the Spotlight the signs will be "tilted downwards and turned off between
midnight and 6 a.m."
The city council hearing is scheduled to take place on Feb. 15
