Vote for Jenny,
My fellow students I know you don't want to sit through any more long speeches, so I'll keep this short.
Today I want to speak about an atrocity, nay, an injustice which must be corrected.
Of course I am referring to the lack of sushi options in this, our beloved cafeteria.
Now, I know that some of you prefer pizza to sushi, and that's okay. You're wrong, but that's okay. People have a right to be wrong.
But for the rest of us, we must march, we must shout, we must take to the streets and protest!
And as your class president I will lead the way.
Join me, and together, we'll never go hungry for sushi again!
Thank you, and don't forget to vote for Jenny!
