A single grain of rice can tip the scale.
One person may be the difference between victory and defeat.
I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.
You stole your father's armor
ran away from home, impersonated a soldier
deceived your commanding officer
dishonored the Chinese Army
destroyed my palace
and you have saved us all.
