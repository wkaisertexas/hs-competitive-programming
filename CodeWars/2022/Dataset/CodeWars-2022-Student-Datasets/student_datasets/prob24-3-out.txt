Friends, students, those of you whom I've waved to in the halls
I am running for class president for one simple reason.
We need better books in our library.
I mean, listen, I love a cringe-fest about sparkly vampires as much as the next person
but I think we can do better.
Our school's purchasing patterns are sus.
Until I see something like Well Beauty Woke by Nonieqa Ramos
Azura Ghost by Essa Hansen or Renegade Moon by T A Chan on those shelves
I will keep pushing for more and better, and I invite you all to stand with me.
Join me, and together we can usher in a new age of better book reports for everyone!
Vote for Elizabeth.
Thank you.
