[Vote,short.] [Today,cafeteria] [Now,wrong.] [But,protest!] [And,Jenny!]
And as your class pre-SQUIRREL I will lead the way.
Jo-SQUIRREL me, and together, we'll never go hungry for sushi again!
Thank you, and don't forget to vo-SQUIRREL for Jenny!
But for the rest of us, we must march, we must shout, we must take to the streets and pro-SQUIRREL
Today I want to speak about an atrocity, nay, an in-SQUIRREL which must be corrected.
Of course I am referring to the lack of su-SQUIRREL options in this, our beloved cafeteria.
Now, I know that some of you prefer pi-SQUIRREL to sushi, and that's okay. You're wrong, but that's okay. People have a right to be wr-SQUIRREL
Vote for Jenny,
My fellow st-SQUIRREL I know you don't want to sit through any more long speeches, so I'll keep this sho-SQUIRREL
