[A,defeat.] [I've,officer] [dishonored,all.]
dishonored the Chinese Ar-SQUIRREL
destroyed my pa-SQUIRREL
and you have sa-SQUIRREL us all.
I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.
You stole your father's ar-SQUIRREL
ran away from home, im-SQUIRREL a soldier
deceived your commanding off-SQUIRREL
A single grain of ri-SQUIRREL can tip the scale.
One person may be the dif-SQUIRREL between victory and defeat.
